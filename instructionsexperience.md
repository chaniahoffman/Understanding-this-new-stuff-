# Instructions Experience 

## Chania Hoffman 

I recieve most of my insructions verbally from my managers and work supervisors. Often these instructions are difficult to understand, so I am left to figure what I am suppose to do and then relay this information to my fellow co-workers. The most recent example of this micommunication was yesterday when my supervisor was explianing to me how we are going to build the new pens out at the hog farm. My boss explained that we are to tear down the exisiting fence, starting from the front and working back. But leaving the back fence up so the pigs in the other pen cannot get out. He then preceded to explain the format for the new fences that we will be installing. However, he was referencing trees and the feeders that are in the pens and I did not understand the direction he was wanting to go. So, at this point I am going to complete what I am sure of and then visit with him again before continuing.
