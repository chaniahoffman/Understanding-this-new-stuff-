## The process I use for Writing 

*Writing All the Time*

**NO Free Time**

When I begin to write a paper, typically I think about the topic for a while before I begin to write. I organize some main ideas in my head and then I sit down and write. I don"t draw up an outline because I never follow it anyways. So it just ends up getting in my way and confusing me. I use Microsoft Word as my medium. I use Times New Roman 12pt font and double space everything. I read over the paper if I have time or I let the computer read it to me. I run spell check and then either print or submit the paper, depending on what the requirements are.
